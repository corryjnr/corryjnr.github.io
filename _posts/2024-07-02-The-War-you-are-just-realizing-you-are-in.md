title: The War we are all fighting.
---

Are you aware that you're fighting a war you'll probably lose? The war has many fronts, and those who aren't even aware of it may be doing better than those who are. It's the matrix – the veil covering your eyes, the lens you use to make sense of the world. It's an ongoing fight – the war of consciousness.

We can call it the human condition. The only way out, as far as I know, is enlightenment. It's a word we know and don't know – a distant and desired state where all our problems cease to exist. It's the closest we can get to being like God.

I want enlightenment, and I'm sure you do too. But how do we reach this unknown, unreachable state? Do we have to become monks or lose ourselves in yogic practices? Frankly, I don't know. For now, I'm just trying to put down the few pieces of information that I have on this blog.

One thing about enlightenment is that acquiring more knowledge can be an advantage or the very thing that distracts us from it.

> Enlightenment is freedom from the matrix.

We may never be completely free from the matrix, but we must try. We must do our best to strive for complete peace and happiness.

I believe that aiming for enlightenment is how we find and create meaning in our lives. It's the journey from finding meaning in the external to the internal.
