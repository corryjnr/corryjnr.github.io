Be real we are told whenever we dream too big or think too much outside the norm. But who defines this reality? It is in my opinion people like us, who are not satisfied with the real as it is put. The bold define what real is.

Beforen the computers there was a reality that didn't involve computers, but others sought more, and they weren't being 'real', and so they redefined reality. 
> We redefine reality by living and not reliving.

And so my aim is to live and not relive.

    To create and not just emulate.
    To be more than the current accepted or recognized reality.
