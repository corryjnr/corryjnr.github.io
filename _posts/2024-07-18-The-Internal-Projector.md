title: The Internal Projector

I read somewhere that deep at our core, the I am, is consciousness. This conciousness which sits at our center is full of awareness. It projects this awareness to the internally and external world. Awareness is knowing without labeling. It is what happens when you look in a direction and immideately know everything that is infront of you without having the internal dialogue in your head label it.
