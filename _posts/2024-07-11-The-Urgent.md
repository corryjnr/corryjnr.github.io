The thing that is currently urgent has been in the background for some time.

It's urgency is as a result of your conscious mind only now picking it up. Think of kost times when you were sick. The sickness does not just pop up from nowhere and immediately becomes an emergency. No, it has been in the background for some time, growing, your body trying to fight it and when it finally becomes visible it's as a result of the battle that has been going on deep down that has probably failed.

This applies to many things. Our worries, fears and more. They have all been in the background.

So whenever you have an emergency as yourself when did this start? How did I not notice it?

And for things that are not yet urgent, the simple things that you are ignoring, procastinating on, ask how they will impact your life when they finally become urgent.

Will they result in emergencies? And will you be read to deal with them then or are you better pf dealing with it before it becomes an emergency.
