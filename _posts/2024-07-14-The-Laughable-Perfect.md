title: The Laughable Perfect
---

Perfect by definiton is a state of ultimate excellence. It is unomprovable. This is why it is laughable.

Imperfect beings wanting to create perfect things which they themselves have never even seen. I fyou really consider it you will realise there are no perfect things. Unless we redefine perfect.

This is the trap, the trap of perfection. It is an impossibility. And even if it were possible, you cannot expect to start from nothing and immediately attain perfection. It is like aiming to create a vehicle whose speed is above the speed of light without having ever created a vehicle in the first place. I hope you see the absurdity of it –– this is not to say we can never attain the speed of light as a pecies.

So we must laugh at it. We must laugh at ourselves for wanting things to be perfect. As the Cult of Done Manifeso puts it, "Laugh at perfection, It's boring and keeps you from being done".

Try to imagine anything perfect for a minute. Now try to imagine something that you can do to improve it. If you put enough effort in this thought experiment you will realize there is still the possibility of improvement and therefore it is imperfect. And so it stands to reason that the very desire for perfection originates from our desire as imperfect beings to control this infinetely large and chaotic universe that we live in.

Why? I don't know. I do know one thing though, it is a trap. I have fallen into this trap myself countless times and I still will. The perfect time, the perfect date, the perfect house, the perfect partner, the perfect career, the perfect business––you can go on and on with this list. Look at it with a smile on your face, the self-limiting nature of it. Laugh at it and escape it.

Start where you are––imperfection––and do the work, continually iterating until you get to your best work. Apply this to everything including your self.

Let's imagine that it was possible to achieve perfection. Gow would you know what the perfect version of anything would look like without starting, without putting in the work and the hours.

So today I implore you to just start and put in your best to create your best. If you are ever to achieve perfection it would be through this––to give your all and your best.

Notice the difference between best and perfect. Best is a measurement of input and output on a scale against other efforts. Meaning there must have been a previous effort. If there is one of one then it can be the best in that category, but to achieve one of one there must be previous efforts that allows you to distinguish yourself. One of one is not perfect, it can be improved, either by you or someone else. The imprived version would become better and therefore the new best.

Now remember you are one of one in this world and your best is determined by you. The honest you. And it is impossible for anyone to compete with you in this category. It also means this is the easiest category to fall into the perfection trap and also the best place to do your best.
