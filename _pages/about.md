Welcome to my personal website! I'm thrilled to have you here.

## Who Am I?

I'm **Michael Corry Otieno**, a passionate and dedicated developer with a keen interest in creating innovative and impactful projects. I specialize in web development, with a strong focus on front-end technologies, but I also enjoy working on back-end and full-stack projects.

## My Journey

My journey into the world of programming began [X] years ago when I wrote my first lines of code. Since then, I've immersed myself in learning and building, continuously expanding my skill set and taking on new challenges.

## What I Do

I love creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. Here are some of the areas I excel in:

- **Web Development:** Crafting responsive and dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular.
- **Backend Development:** Building robust and scalable server-side applications with Node.js, Express, and Django.
- **Database Management:** Designing and managing databases with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.
- **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrating third-party APIs to enhance functionality and user experience.

## Why I Do It

My passion for technology stems from the endless possibilities it offers to solve real-world problems. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact, and I'm driven by the desire to create solutions that improve lives and make everyday tasks easier.

## What I'm Up To

When I'm not coding, you can find me [mention your hobbies or interests, e.g., hiking, reading, exploring new technologies, etc.]. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in technology. Feel free to reach out to me via [your preferred contact method, e.g., email, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.].
